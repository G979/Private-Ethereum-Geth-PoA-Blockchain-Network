##Connect to the Virtual Machine

-On Instances tab in AWS right--click on instance ID and click Connect.
*There is no concept of password in this connection. The key pair we saved on creating our VM will act as password

-On the Location(ex. Desktop) when you save your key pair(.pem file), right-click and open Git Bash here to manipulate your connection
-On the new terminal type -->chmod 400 "your_keypair_name".pem.(You can follow the same procedure using node.js command prompt)
-In order to log in the VM type -> ssh -i "your_keypair_name" ubuntu@ec2-"your-instance-id"5.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com. You can find this command on your "Connect to your 
Instance" interface that popped up after you clicked Connect,
-Type yes on the following question and you have connected on your AWS Virtual Machine.

##Install Geth
*When you are connected to the VM follow these commands
-type --->sudo -s (for root privileges for Windows)
-type --->sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
-type --->sudo add-apt-update
-type --->sudo add-apt-get install ethereum
-Finally type ---> geth to make sure the gate is installed on the VM 
**If an application is running and creating nodes then it is OK, BUT you have to keep in mind that is a running application and it costs Virtual Memory so you have
to stop it by pressing Ctrl+C.

##Check if ports are open and the virtual version is working fine
-Open new terminal and type this --> ping your_elastic_ip_address
-If it is successfully replying you have a normal connection. If the requset timed out, then you do not have a normal connection and you have to add some ports in the initial
declaration in AWS. (Add all traffic rule on Inbound Rules and make it available from anywhere, though it is not optimal to keep this port open)

##Create a folder that will be responsible for your Network
Type the following commands on your root-ip user(-->sudo -s command)
-cd /opt/      #enter opt fold
-mkdir your_preffered_directory_name
-cd your_preffered_directory_name
-mkdir node0 (a dir act as the first node of the blockchain)
-cd node0
-ls-la (and test if there are two nodes on the directory)

##Create ethereum/node account
Let's create a simple ethereum account by following these steps:
-type ---> geth --datadir "./data" account new    **ask geth to create new account an store it in the folder named data
-Your new account is locked with a password. You will be asked to give and repeat a password for your ethereum account. Please store it somewhere safe.
-You will be handed a public address of the key. Please store it somewhere safe Example: 0x4C2575F59g0n61B45D70707EA7A2aE47aafa37c1. This is the address of your node0.
*Now if you type -->ls-la <-- you will see a folder called data containing the details of your account. Please don't change anything inside it.

##Build a genesis.json file using puppeth
-type -->puppeth<-- on the node0 location and answer the following questions
  -Please specify name. Type your preferred name(no spaces,hyphen or capital)
  -What you would like to do. Type 2  (Configure new genesis)
  --What you would like to do.Type 1  (Create genesis from scratch)
  ---Consensus engine.Type 2    (Clique-proof of authority)
  ----How many secs?Type 5    (Any number of your choice actually)
  -----Which accounts are allowed to seal? Type your_elastic_ip_address   (the one you have saved)
  ------Which accounts should be pre-funded?   Type your_elastic_ip_address
  -------pre-compile addresses. Type yes
  --------Specify the network ID. Type 9999
  Your genesis.json file is ready
**Ideally check the genesis.json file from this repository and try chopping all the unnecessary nodes from your file also.
